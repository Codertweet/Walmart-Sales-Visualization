 ## Project Description  
Unlocking the power of data visualization, this project dives deep into Walmart's historical sales data to uncover actionable insights and trends that drive retail success. By leveraging the Seaborn library—an elegant, high-level interface built on Matplotlib—we transform raw data into compelling visual narratives.
From bar plots and line graphs to distribution charts, our visual analysis highlights seasonal patterns, sales fluctuations, and growth opportunities across departments and time periods. The project culminates in building a predictive model that forecasts weekly sales, enabling smarter business decisions and forward-looking strategies.
Whether you're a data analyst, business strategist, or ML enthusiast, this project offers a hands-on journey through visual storytelling and sales forecasting.
