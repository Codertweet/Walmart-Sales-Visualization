# Walmart-Sales-Visualization
In this project, we’ll leverage the seaborn and other libraries to analyze Walmart sales data by creating visualizations that can help with sales projections.

## You will learn to:
   * Perform data cleaning to remove outliers and null values.
   * Transform raw data into a usable format for data visualization.  
   * Visualize the correlation between sales and external factors.*
   * Visualize past sales data to help identify sales trends.

Project Description

Data visualization is essential for analyzing sales projections because it turns raw data into insights, providing a clear depiction of the trends that drive business success. These visualizations empower business stakeholders to leverage their data effectively, ensuring sales projections are not only informed by past performance but also offer insights into potential future trajectories.

In this project, we’ll utilize the seaborn library to analyze Walmart sales data, creating visualizations that facilitate sales projections. Seaborn, a Python data visualization library built on Matplotlib, offers a high-level interface for crafting aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical charts. Through seaborn, we will generate various graphs, such as bar charts, line charts, and histograms, to visualize past sales data, identify seasonal trends, and highlight areas for growth or attention. Ultimately, we will conclude the project with the development of a predictive model to forecast weekly sales.
